# candidate-reviewer

## Project Goal

candidate-reviewer is a tool designed to streamline and enhance the candidate evaluation process. This system helps hiring teams efficiently review, assess, and provide feedback on job candidates through a structured and collaborative approach.

**Key Objectives:**
- Simplify candidate assessment workflows
- Enable structured feedback collection from multiple reviewers
- Maintain consistency in evaluation criteria
- Facilitate informed hiring decisions

## Privacy Guarantee

**We take candidate privacy seriously:**

- **No Backend Storage**: This application operates entirely client-side. No candidate data is transmitted to or stored on any external servers.
- **Local Processing**: All data processing happens locally in your browser.
- **Data Control**: You have complete control over candidate information. Data remains on your device and can be cleared at any time.
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: We do not use analytics, tracking cookies, or any third-party services that could access candidate data.
- **Secure by Design**: No backend means no data breaches, no unauthorized access, and no compliance concerns with sensitive candidate information.
